# RoverMerkle
Work in progress of the Rover Kata Demostration for Merkle.

As part as the process of recruitment of Merkle, I was given the challenge of doing the Kata Demostration of a Rover System.


This Rover System that I made is TDD oriented and it has two test files (at the current moment).

Patch 2.1 Update:
After Patch 2.1, the logic and arithmetic part of the calculations for the system are made and now it's time to refine the code and give some proper tools to work with, for example diverse kind of APIs as Spring or Rest.

Patch 3.0 Update: 
After this Patch, the Rover system is mainly done with all the requirements fulfilled and with a easy-to-use REST API to make commands and to show an image of the actual map of Mars.

This patch is in major part the refinement of the code (so it's easy to read) and to make the code to represent the Rover into the map in a image file that can be shown to the user.

The commands to use the RESTAPI are easy:
http://localhost:911/rover/command/{command}
  For example you can put a series of chars and it's going to work, such as http://localhost:911/rover/command/fflflflrb
http://localhost:911/rover/getMap
  You're going to get the map of the planet that you created

It was a fun project to make and to do things easily. Now I can say that the project is no longer in WIP and it's now readable for the Kata evaluators.

# Thank you!
