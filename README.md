# RoverMerkle
Work in progress of the Rover Kata Demostration for Merkle.

As part as the process of recruitment of Merkle, I was given the challenge of doing the Kata Demostration of a Rover System.


This Rover System that I made is TDD oriented and it has two test files (at the current moment).

Patch 2.1 Update:
After Patch 2.1, the logic and arithmetic part of the calculations for the system are made and now it's time to refine the code and give some proper tools to work with, for example diverse kind of APIs as Spring or Rest.
